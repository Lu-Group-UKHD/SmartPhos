\title{Read Phosphorylation Data for One Sample from DIA}
\usage{
readOnePhosDIA(inputTab, sampleName, localProbCut = 0.75, removeDup = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{inputTab}{A data.table or data.frame containing phosphorylation data.}

\item{sampleName}{A character string specifying the sample name.}

\item{localProbCut}{A numeric value specifying the cutoff for localization probability. Default is `0.75`.}

\item{removeDup}{A logical value indicating whether to remove duplicate entries based on `UniprotID` and intensity. Default is FALSE.}
}
\value{
A data.table containing the processed phosphorylation data for the specified sample.
}
\description{
`readOnePhosDIA` reads and processes phosphorylation data for a single sample from a DIA experiment, applying filters for localization probability and removing duplicates if specified.
}
\details{
This function processes phosphorylation data for a single sample by filtering based on localization probability and non-zero intensity. It handles multiplicity by summarizing intensities and optionally removes duplicates. The resulting data is returned as a data.table with unique identifiers.
}
\examples{
inputTab <- data.table::fread("phosphorylation_data.tsv")
result <- readOnePhosDIA(inputTab, "Sample_1", localProbCut = 0.75, removeDup = TRUE)
