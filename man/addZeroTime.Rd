\title{Add Zero Timepoint Data to Treatment Subset}
\usage{
addZeroTime(data, condition, treat, zeroTreat, timeRange)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A SummarizedExperiment object containing the experimental data.}

\item{condition}{The condition corresponds to one of the columns from the colData of SE object.}

\item{treat}{Character string specifying the treatment to which zero timepoint should be added.}

\item{zeroTreat}{Character string specifying the treatment representing the zero timepoint.}

\item{timeRange}{Character vector specifying the timepoints to include for the treatment.}
}
\value{
A SummarizedExperiment object with the zero timepoint added to the specified treatment's data.
}
\description{
`addZeroTime` adds a zero timepoint to a specific treatment's data subset.
}
\details{
The function performs the following steps:
\enumerate{
  \item Subsets the data for the specified treatment and time range.
  \item Subsets the data for the zero timepoint of the specified zero treatment.
  \item Combines the assays from the treatment and zero timepoint subsets.
  \item Updates the column data to reflect the combined treatment.
  \item Returns a SummarizedExperiment object with the combined data.
}
}
\examples{
# Example usage:
# Assuming data is a SummarizedExperiment object with appropriate data
# result <- addZeroTime(data, treat = "TreatmentA", zeroTreat = "Control", timeRange = c("10min", "20min"))

}
