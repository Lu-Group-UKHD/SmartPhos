Description: 
    To facilitate and streamline phosphoproteomics data analysis, we developed
    SmartPhos, an R package for the pre-processing, quality control, and 
    exploratory analysis of phosphoproteomics data generated by MaxQuant and 
    Spectronaut. The package can be used either through the R command line or 
    through an interactive ShinyApp called SmartPhos Explorer. The package 
    contains methods such as normalization and normalization correction, 
    transformation, imputation, batch effect correction, PCA, heatmap, 
    differential expression, time-series clustering, gene set enrichment analysis,
    and kinase activity inference.
